		<h4>Welcome and thanks for helping with the translation of Openki</h4>
		<p>Here are some guidelines and some help, please read them carefully before you start to translate.</p>

		We use a casual, every day language for the interface.
		<ul>
			<li> Try to sound as natural as possible.</li>
			<li> Openki is on a first-name basis with all users.</li>
			<li> It's totally ok to address the user informally as if they were a good friend.</li>
		</ul>

		Where possible we use a gender-neutral, inclusive language.
		<ul>
			<li> We avoid gender-specific pronouns and try to use gender-neutral ones...</li>
			<li> As well we use gender-neutral titles and roles.</li>
			<li> ...without sounding too weird though.</li>
		</ul>

		Some technical stuff:
		<ul>
			<li> Words in capital letters in brackets like <code>{NAME}</code> are variables. Transfer them as they are.</li>
			<li> "Don't forget 'all' the punctuation (marks)!"...</li>
			<li> In some languages capitalization differs from English. Otherwise transfer them too.</li>
			<li> Sometimes there are multiple translations in one string. Ex. when there is <code>no participant</code>, but <code>1 participant</code> and <code>2 participants</code>.<br>
			So we need a translation for each case. One for zero (=0), one for one (=1), one for te rest (other). The used syntax is as follows: <br>
			<code>Create {COUNT, plural, one {event} other {# events}}</code> becomes: <br>
			<code>Erstelle {COUNT, plural, one {Veranstaltung} other {# Veranstaltungen}}</code></li>
			<li> # stands for a Number.</li>
			<li> There are no save-buttons. Strings get saved as you move to the next one or away from the translation page.</li>
		</ul>
